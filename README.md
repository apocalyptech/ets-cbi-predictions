Nine Inch Nails' "COLD and BLACK and INFINITE" tour, in late 2018, has
been featuring some absolutely insane setlists, pulling out lots of
songs which fans assumed would never be played, and offering tons of
surprises for folks going to multiple shows.

Since there was a convenient month-long break in the middle of the tour,
I thought it would be fun to set up a little betting pool of what
other surprises might pop up in the second half of the tour.  That's
happening at ETS over here:

This script is just here to do all the actual scoring for me, and is
unlikely to be of interest to anyone but myself (and, of course, will
be extra pointless once the tour wraps up).  Regardless, here's hoping
that we *do* end up getting some more surprises, otherwise this is
an awful lot of overkill.  :)

The script is written in Python, and only tested on Python 3, though
I'm not aware of anything in there which would prevent it from working
in Python 2, as well.
