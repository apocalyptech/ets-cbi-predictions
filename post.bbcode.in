So we're a bit over halfway through Cold and Black and Infinite, and we've got this little reprieve before the gang gets back on the road.  I don't think [i]anyone[/i] could've predicted the kinds of insane setlists we've been getting this time around, and at this point it sort of feels like practically anything's possible.

So, how about we place some bets about what new songs might get debuted in the remainder of the tour?  Not, like, with money or anything, but here's the general gist of what I was thinking:

[size=+1][b]Method[/b][/size]

Each person puts their votes in a single post.  Put down the [i]full[/i] list of stuff that you think'll debut in the remainder of the tour, and then we'll wait and see.  Full points for predictions would stop at the start time of the first Mexico City date -- any posts edited/added past that time will get fewer points.  Then once the tour's over, it gets scored something like this:

[indent]

[b]Vocals:[/b]
[indent]
Correct prediction: [b]+100 pts[/b]
Bonus points for a never-been-played song: [b]+50 pts[/b]
Wrong prediction: [b]-50 pts[/b]
Debut which you didn't guess: [b]-25 pts[/b]
[/indent]

[b]Instrumentals / Covers:[/b]
[indent]
Correct prediction: [b]+150 pts[/b]
Wrong prediction: [b]-75 pts[/b]
Debut which you didn't guess: [b]-10pts[/b]
[/indent]

Bonus points if you correctly guess all debuts: [b]+100 pts[/b]

If no new debuts, and you post with "no debuts": [s][b]+100 pts[/b][/s] [i](though that would certainly be a shame; too late to get any points for guessing this one, though!)[/i]
[/indent]

[i]Example:[/i] Let's say I predict Down In It, Heresy, and God Given.  By the end of the tour, I've gotten pretty lucky and they've performed DII and Heresy, but also No, You Don't and Into the Void.  So I get +200 for my correct predictions, -50 for the one I got totally wrong, and then -50 for the two that I missed.  So my score ends up at 100.

Predictions for full-album playthroughs should probably be weighted a bit more heavily, yeah?  I'm proposing the following:

[indent]
[i](points for successful prediction / subtraction for incorrect prediction)[/i]
[b]Pretty Hate Machine:[/b] +1000 / -500
[b]The Downward Spiral:[/b] +500 / -250
[b]The Fragile (left):[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]The Fragile (right):[/b] +2000 / -1000
[b]With Teeth:[/b] + 1200 / -600
[b]Year Zero:[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]The Slip:[/b] +1000 / -500
[b]Hesitation Marks:[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]NTAE:[/b] +300 / -150
[b]ADD VIOLENCE:[/b] +300 / -150
[b]Bad Witch:[/b] +300 / -150
[/indent]

I haven't really thought the exact point values through too much -- this was mostly a driving-home-from-groceries-with-not-much-else-to-think-about thing -- so I'm open to suggestions.  Ties get broken by earliest post timestamp, I suppose.  My thought was to penalize folks from casting too wide a prediction net, with the negative points, but also encourage a bit of boldness.  Instrumentals/Covers should, IMO, carry a bigger reward/penalty since those are in general far less likely.  I omitted a never-been-played category in there 'cause I think at this point basically all of them would be in there, yeah?

Winner gets the warm glow of contentment and pleasure that comes from having beaten the odds!

Fun, possibly?  I think so.

The tour is not yet over, so these will (hopefully) change at least once or twice as the band pulls out some new shit for us.  If you know Python, feel free to check my scoring logic at [url]https://github.com/apocalyptech/ets-cbi-predictions/blob/master/scores.py[/url]

Dryalex12 and theimage13 (and technically elevenism) are benefitting from my allowing their cheeky "a song will be played" predictions.  Esperanzan is also benefitting from the "Not WITT" guess.  Oddly, nobody thought to guess some extra HTDA covers, which seems obvious in hindsight.  Total debuts so far: 2.  Total correct guesses: 0.

paul_guyet is being a little unfairly scored at the moment, since I realize that the predictions I put down in there include both "All of TDS", plus a few TDS tracks.  I'll have to figure out what to do about that in a bit, but that score should be a bit higher than it is.

A bit silly to have a scoring system where probably practically [i]everyone[/i] is gonna be in negative points forever, isn't it?  Ah well.
