[size=+1][b]Conclusion[/b][/size]

NIN's [i]Cold and Black and Infinite[/i] 2018 tour has now officially wrapped up, and we have learned at least one thing: we are [i]terrible[/i] at predicting NIN setlists.  Total new song debuts: [b]7[/b].  Total correct guesses: [b]0[/b].  To be fair, the only debuted songs in the second half of the tour were either HTDA "covers" (is it really a cover if every bandmember apart from Rob Sheridan was onstage?), or due to Mike Garson being around, but still: [i]one[/i] of us really should've put our virtual money on some HTDA appearances.  I mean, come on, folks.

Anyway, since there were no actual "real" points given to anyone over this whole thing, we must be a little fuzzier with our placements:
[list]
[*] If we take into account the cheeky "a song will be played" style votes which I'd given 2 points to, [b]Dryalex12[/b] technically wins the contest, by virtue of low voting standards.  Well done!
[*] If we ignore those, [b]loopcloses[/b] is the more "proper" winner, being the first person to bet so conservatively (only a single track), and so was punished less for the wrong prediction than nearly everyone else.
[*] [b]Esperanzan[/b] gets an honorable mention, since I allowed the vote "NOT We're In This Together" to provide some points.  Apart from the shenanigans mentioned above, these were the only positive points on the board!  Though it was quite offset by the rest of Esperanzan's enthusiastic voting.
[*] A further honorable mention goes to [b]K-Rice[/b], for being bold enough to put in a vote for "all of The Fragile", which put the initial score way down to the very bottom, where it remained for the remainder of the game.  Shoot for the stars!
[/list]

That's about it, really!  I still think that this idea could be expanded into a more general "setlist prediction" game, which could be used on future tours, but I suspect that would be a hell of a lot of work for not much gain.  Time will tell!

Thanks for engaging in this bit of silliness with me -- this was a truly stellar tour, and it was awesome watching it unfold.

If you know Python, feel free to check my scoring logic at [url]https://github.com/apocalyptech/ets-cbi-predictions/blob/master/scores.py[/url], not that it really matters.  :)

paul_guyet is being a little unfairly scored at the moment, since I realize that the predictions I put down in there include both "All of TDS", plus a few TDS tracks, but in the end it didn't turn out to be important enough to look into much.  Sorry, paul_guyet, if your placement should be a bit higher than it is.

A bit silly to have a scoring system where literally [i]everyone[/i] is in negative points forever, isn't it?  Ah well.

[size=+1][b]Original Intro[/b][/size]

So we're a bit over halfway through Cold and Black and Infinite, and we've got this little reprieve before the gang gets back on the road.  I don't think [i]anyone[/i] could've predicted the kinds of insane setlists we've been getting this time around, and at this point it sort of feels like practically anything's possible.

So, how about we place some bets about what new songs might get debuted in the remainder of the tour?  Not, like, with money or anything, but here's the general gist of what I was thinking:

[size=+1][b]Method[/b][/size]

Each person puts their votes in a single post.  Put down the [i]full[/i] list of stuff that you think'll debut in the remainder of the tour, and then we'll wait and see.  Full points for predictions would stop at the start time of the first Mexico City date -- any posts edited/added past that time will get fewer points.  Then once the tour's over, it gets scored something like this:

[indent]

[b]Vocals:[/b]
[indent]
Correct prediction: [b]+100 pts[/b]
Bonus points for a never-been-played song: [b]+50 pts[/b]
Wrong prediction: [b]-50 pts[/b]
Debut which you didn't guess: [b]-25 pts[/b]
[/indent]

[b]Instrumentals / Covers:[/b]
[indent]
Correct prediction: [b]+150 pts[/b]
Wrong prediction: [b]-75 pts[/b]
Debut which you didn't guess: [b]-10pts[/b]
[/indent]

Bonus points if you correctly guess all debuts: [b]+100 pts[/b]

If no new debuts, and you post with "no debuts": [s][b]+100 pts[/b][/s] [i](though that would certainly be a shame; too late to get any points for guessing this one, though!)[/i]
[/indent]

[i]Example:[/i] Let's say I predict Down In It, Heresy, and God Given.  By the end of the tour, I've gotten pretty lucky and they've performed DII and Heresy, but also No, You Don't and Into the Void.  So I get +200 for my correct predictions, -50 for the one I got totally wrong, and then -50 for the two that I missed.  So my score ends up at 100.

Predictions for full-album playthroughs should probably be weighted a bit more heavily, yeah?  I'm proposing the following:

[indent]
[i](points for successful prediction / subtraction for incorrect prediction)[/i]
[b]Pretty Hate Machine:[/b] +1000 / -500
[b]The Downward Spiral:[/b] +500 / -250
[b]The Fragile (left):[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]The Fragile (right):[/b] +2000 / -1000
[b]With Teeth:[/b] + 1200 / -600
[b]Year Zero:[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]The Slip:[/b] +1000 / -500
[b]Hesitation Marks:[/b] +1500 / -750
[b]NTAE:[/b] +300 / -150
[b]ADD VIOLENCE:[/b] +300 / -150
[b]Bad Witch:[/b] +300 / -150
[/indent]

I haven't really thought the exact point values through too much -- this was mostly a driving-home-from-groceries-with-not-much-else-to-think-about thing -- so I'm open to suggestions.  Ties get broken by earliest post timestamp, I suppose.  My thought was to penalize folks from casting too wide a prediction net, with the negative points, but also encourage a bit of boldness.  Instrumentals/Covers should, IMO, carry a bigger reward/penalty since those are in general far less likely.  I omitted a never-been-played category in there 'cause I think at this point basically all of them would be in there, yeah?

Winner gets the warm glow of contentment and pleasure that comes from having beaten the odds!

Fun, possibly?  I think so.
